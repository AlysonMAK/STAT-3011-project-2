# STAT-3011-project-2: Intel Image Classification


## Data
### 1. [Intel image dataset (click here)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d2qrliP_gJa1TB0ReBa58_roT1rHxbI3?usp=sharing) 
This file contains raw data retrieved from Intel.
### 2. [transformed numpy data (click here)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P6G9zwQvKL7lEmDiiSZD8Z6SaxjivjAX/view?usp=sharing)
In this npz file, all images are transfomed to dataframes with dimensions 224, 224 and 3. Therefore, it can be directly put into AlexNet and ResNet models.

## Code
(1) import_packages: the code to import packages relevant to our study

(1) data collection: the code used to for images scrapping.

(3) convert_numpy: the code that transofroms row data to dataframes with dimensions 224, 224 and 3.

(4) Model folder: the code to fit models including KNN, SVM, LeNet, AlexNet and ResNet.

! Notice that each ipynb file can be run directly after setting correct path and import all relevant packages.
